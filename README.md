Automate AWS access key generation and rotation.
AWS Access Key Rotator

The "aws_access_key_rotator.py" script automates the generation and rotation of AWS access keys and secret access keys for an IAM user. This can help improve the security of AWS accounts by ensuring that access keys are regularly rotated and not reused for an extended period.
Prerequisites

Before running the script, you will need to have:

    An AWS account with IAM user access
    Python 3 installed
    The Boto3 Python library installed

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-access-key-rotator.git

    Install the required Python packages:

pip install boto3 argparse

Usage

To use the script, run it with the following command:

php

python aws_access_key_rotator.py <IAM username> [--threshold-age <days>]

Replace <IAM username> with the name of the IAM user you want to manage, and <days> with the age threshold (in days) for rotating the access key (default is 90 days).

For example, to rotate the access key for the user "myuser" with a threshold of 30 days, run:

css

python aws_access_key_rotator.py myuser --threshold-age 30

Security Considerations

    Access keys and secret access keys are sensitive information that should be protected like passwords.
    Be sure to store the access keys and secret access keys securely, such as in an encrypted file or a password manager.
    Use strong passwords for IAM users and rotate them regularly.
    Monitor IAM activity and set up alerts for suspicious activity.
